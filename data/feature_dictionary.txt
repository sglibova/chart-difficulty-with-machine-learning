-----Explanation of Song Features Used for Modeling-----

-----target variables-----

● difficulty - string containing one of the following ['Beginner, Easy, Medium, Hard, Challenge, Edit']

● rating - numerical value of difficulty [1-28] 

-----descriptive variables, not used in calculations-----

● title - song title

● artist - song artist  

-----song statistics, used in calculations-----

● song_seconds - length of the song in seconds 

● step_count - number of individual steps per chart

● measure_count - number of measures per chart, comma-separated in the song files themselves  

● bpm_weighted_avg - bpm of a song weighted by how long each song is at the corresponding bpm

● bpm_max - max bpm of the song  

● bpm_min - minimum bpm of the song

● bpm_mode - most frequent bpm of the song

● bpm_change_count - how often the bpm changes within the song

● song_nps - notes per second, song notes/song seconds

● nps_per_measure_max - highest song NPS (highest density)

● nps_per_measure_avg - average NPS over all measures - sum of all NPS per measure/total measures

● nps_per_measure_median - middle value of NPS over all measures

● nps_per_measure_std - standard deviation of NPS by measure, or the +/- distance from the mean

● nps_per_measure_mode - most frequent NPS

● jumps - player steps on 2 panels at the same time

● hands - player steps on 3 panels at the same time

● quads - player steps on all 4 panels at the same time

● holds - player steps and holds panel(s), indicated by an arrow with a smooth trail under it

● mines - 'explosive' arrow, to be intentionally avoided

● rolls - player must step on and repeatedly tap a panel for the entire duration of the roll, indicated by a trail (looks like a hold but jagged)
 
● crossovers - player crosses one foot over to step on the next arrow 

● footswitches - player steps on the same arrow with alternating feet

● crossover_footswitches -  

● jacks - player repeatedly steps on the same panel with the same foot

● invalid_crossovers -  player crosses one foot to step on the next arrow, but stays in this position for over 9 steps with no jumps or hands (essentially crossed over for too long)

● stop_count - number of times the song intentionally stops

● stream_count - number of measures that are considered a stream - at least 14 notes of a measure with maximum note value of 16th

-----below variables are mostly used for stamina data-----

● stream_size_max - the largest value of back-to-back stream measures in the song

● stream_size_avg - mean value of back-to-back stream measures in the song

● stream_size_std - how far each stream is +/- from the mean stream size

● break_count - number of 'rest' measures between streams

● break_size_max - largest number of rest measures between streams

● break_size_avg - average break per song

● break_total - total number of breaks

● break_size_std - how far each break is +/- from
