--Explanation of Song Features Used for Modeling--

● Song duration - length of the song in seconds 
 
● BPM - beats per minute (how fast the song is)

● Total number of steps 

● Number of changes in BPM, if any  

● Number of jumps, hands, and quads - any time a player steps on 2, 3, or 4 arrows at the same time  

● Song density - number of steps or notes per second of the song

● Peak NPS - the highest density value 

● Number of song measures containing a “stream” - number of measures with continued steps with
no break valued at a 16th note or higher
  
● Number of crossovers, footswitches, jacks, sideswitches, and brackets
(each of these is a technical element requiring a particular style of
stepping)  

● Number of “mines” - number of "arrows" that are meant to be purposefully avoided
due to them “exploding” if stepped on and decreasing the player’s score

● Classification of whether the chart is a “stamina” chart or not - this is one
of the most important distinctions because difficulty ratings for stamina
songs look very different from other songs. Stamina songs typically start
north of 2.5 minutes long and some even exceed several hours! To
address this kind of outlying information, it may be worth splitting the
data into “stamina” data and “non-stamina” data.
